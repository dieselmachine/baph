# Certain versions of pypy have a bug where clearing the exception stack
# breaks the __exit__ function in a very peculiar way.  The second level of
# exception blocks is necessary because pypy seems to forget to check if an
# exception happened until the next bytecode instruction?
#
# Relevant PyPy bugfix commit:
# https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy/commits/77ecf91c635a287e88e60d8ddb0f4e9df4003301
# According to ronan on #pypy IRC, it is released in PyPy2 2.3 and later
# versions.
#
# Ubuntu 14.04 has PyPy 2.2.1, which does exhibit this bug.
